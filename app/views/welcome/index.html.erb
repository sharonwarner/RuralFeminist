        <p>Rural women face unique difficulties: <%= link_to 'finding medical care', 'https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20658893', target: :_blank %>, <%= link_to 'escaping domestic violence', 'https://www.hrsa.gov/advisorycommittees/rural/publications/partnerviolencemarch2015.pdf', target: :_blank %>, and <%= link_to 'accessing community services', 'https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3923420/', target: :_blank %> are particularly challenging in sparsely populated areas. As <%= link_to 'economic growth concentrates more and more in urban areas', 'http://eig.org/recoverymap#mapReport', target: :_blank %>, <%= link_to 'manufacturing jobs move overseas or become automated', 'https://www.kansascityfed.org/publicat/mse/MSE_1201.pdf', target: :_blank %>, and <%= link_to 'wealth inequality grows', 'http://inequality.org/inequality-data-statistics/', target: :_blank %>, these problems are exacerbated. Rural women are juggling the responsibilities of caring for themselves and their families with rapidly declining resources. Why is it that as the feminist movement has risen in popularity, rural women have been left further behind?</p>

    <p>Over the past several years, the term “feminist” has become just another way of saying “urban, upper-class woman” -- women such as Ivanka Trump, Sheryl Sandberg, and Lena Dunham all consider themselves feminists while doing little to understand or help with the struggles of women from different backgrounds. Such a narrow definition of feminism fails to encapsulate the varying ways in which women struggle because of sexism.</p>
    <p>Intersectional feminists have recognized these shortcomings and are redefining the movement. This new intersectional feminist movement is focused on the struggles of poor women, women of color, women with disabilities or illnesses, and other women left out of previous feminist movements. It is time for rural women to take our place in this movement.</p>
    <h4>We are a group of rural women and intersectional feminists choosing to work together to organize and fight for our shared core values.</h4>
    <p></p>
    <p>Neither of the two major political parties have specifically addressed the core political values of rural women as articulated below. Rather, they choose to continue pushing policies that benefit their corporate donors. Thus, we are purposefully not affiliated with either party, but we will support politicians with a demonstrable record of fighting for our core values. We will not resort to the sexist, racist, homophobic, transphobic, or classist rhetoric that is prevalent in today’s political climate.</p>

    <p>Over the past several months, the founders of Rural Feminist have interviewed dozens of rural women about the political issues that most affect their day to day lives. We heard inspiring stories from women fighting to give their daughters more chances than they had. We heard from women who are disillusioned by today’s toxic political environment. We heard from women who have been left behind by an economy that has not yet recovered. We heard ideas for how the government can better help hardworking women. We compiled their answers into these six core values.</p>
